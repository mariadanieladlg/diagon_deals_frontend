## ✨ Description

Welcome to **Diagon Deals Store** — the magical **admin page** of an e-commerce platform!  
This is the **online version** of the legendary **Diagon Alley shop**, where both wizards and curious muggles can find everything they need for Hogwarts classes and magical adventures.

Our inspiration came from Joshua’s project suggestion — it was so cool we couldn’t resist!  
We imagined merging the magical world with modern technology. Yes, wizards have spells… but have you seen what tech can do? It’s _practically magic_.

💡 Instead of spending hours wandering Diagon Alley looking for discounts, potions, or rare items, now wizards can manage store inventory, keep things organized, and save time for more important tasks — like battling trolls or drinking butterbeer.

_(Special thanks to Merlin himself for approving this project 🧙‍♂️)_
